We are a delicious fast food that fuels your body with real purpose, not crap.</p>

						<p><span>In the Spring of 2016, SumoSalad Truck was born as the ideal path for the future of SumoSaladUSA.</span> Being that we were in Los Angeles - home of the Dodgers, the Lakers, breathtaking coasts, and some of the most incredible food in the nation -  it only made sense that we should spread the love and deliciousness of SumoSalad through a food truck. From our Asian Greens - a mix of broccoli and snap peas tossed with sesame oil and almonds - to our pesto chicken - mixed leafy greens with free range chicken, feta, walnuts, and avocado, we take pride in knowing that our food is not only healthy and delicious, but also that we use only the finest ingredients and our meats come from trusted sources that treat their animals with respect.  We look forward to spreading the SumoSalad love throughout Los Angeles in 2016 and beyond!</p>

At twenty three years old, he left his home for Vegas to realize his goal and worked as a waiter in the Strip to gain experience. There, he met Maty Yuriditsky, founder of SumoSalad USA, who brought him along into the SumoSalad store, and thus began a new chapter of his life, and brought him one step closer to reaching his dream. Now, almost two years later, he is running a very successful food truck with the help of his employees, Louis, Isaac, and Alejandra, and he is happy everyday to see the culmination of his lifeâ€™s work reaching new heights.</div>
